that performance is taken into account. __Done__
- When you click on the thumbnail, a modal light-box must be displayed that allows the user to
navigate within individuals GIFS as a slideshow. The GIFS on this view must be fully animated. __Partial Done__
- Create a user experience design very polished and refined.
- Create code in a clean, readable way, allowing normal conventions. __Done__
